## My Philosophy

- Get it out there, gather feedback, and improve. Overthinking kills momentum.
- Predictable, boring code is usually best.
- Small details add up. If something feels off, it probably is.
- Open-source is gold. Let's build together.
- Experimentation goes along with theory. Fail fast, learn faster.
